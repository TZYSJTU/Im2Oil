## Acknowledgments
- I am extremely grateful to my coworkers' advice, comments, and encouragement, which greatly improves this work. 
## Examples
We give three examples that can be run directly (the hyperparameters of these three examples have been fixed).  
### Quick start
- To draw the cat: `python cat.py`
- To draw the dog: `python dog.py`
- To draw the girl: `python girl.py`

## Instructions
To draw arbitrary input: `python process_order.py`. Of course you need to adjust the following parameters.
### Hyperparameters
- `input_path = './input/your file'` Input image path
- `output_path = './output'` Do not change this
- `n =  10` Gray-scale quantization order
- `period = 5` Line(stroke) width
- `direction =  10` Direction quantization order
- `Freq = 100` Save the drawing process every `Freq` strokes are drawn
- `deepen =  1` Edge map's intensity. The bigger, the darker.
- `transTone = False` Do not change this
- `kernel_radius = 3` Edge tangent flow kernel size, do not change this
- `iter_time = 15` Edge tangent flow kernel iterations times, do not change this
- `background_dir = None`  Whether fix the drawing direction in the background, this value could be `None` or an integer between `(0~180)`
- `CLAHE = True` Whether input uses CLAHE (Do not change this)
- `edge_CLAHE = True` Whether edge map uses CLAHE (Do not change this)
- `draw_new = True` Do not change this
- `random_order = False` Use random drawing order if `True`
- `ETF_order = True` Use the drawing order described in our paper if `True`
- `process_visible = True` Whether show the drawing process 

In our supplementary material (PDF), we explain these hyperparameters in more detail and we show more comparisons with existing pencil drawing algorithms. We also offer more
results of our method. Our Supplementary Material is available at Baidu Netdisk (百度网盘) https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZZEmpuPXRNBPvG0WHbbPKA. The extraction code (提取码) is `1234`.
